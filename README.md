# White Wine quality 

This report explores a dataset containing quality rates and attributes of about 5,000 white wines.The inputs are physicochemical test results (e.g. pH or citric acid) and the output is a sensory data of the wine quality (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

The dataset is related to a white variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: <http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/> or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
